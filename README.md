# deck-of-cards
A deck of cards with user interface and simple commands

A set of 52 playing cards, each with their own image (as well as deck logo and shuffle image).
Made to be run on the command line, with a Java compiler.

To compile the source code yourself, compile using 'javac -d ../class *.java'
This is how the file paths for the images can be used properly when running.
To run, go to the class folder and run 'java PlayCards'
